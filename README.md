# Use Class/Object File (Swift)
Just a project more for myself to refer back to when working on future Swift projects. Outputs an array of objects into a formatted .txt file. (Xcode needed)

# Setup
*To Run:*
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/brianhodges/swift-importclass
  cd swift-importclass
  ```
*Build/Run Project and a formatted log.txt file will output to the project root*
